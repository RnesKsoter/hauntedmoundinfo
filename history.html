            <h1>Haunted mound history</h1>
            <h2>Start</h2>
            <p><strong>Sematary</strong> was most active on Tumblr in <em>2013</em>. His influences came from this Tumblr background where he
                got inspired by artists like <strong>chief keef, yung lean</strong> and <strong>black kray</strong>. Alongside his friend <strong>Ghost
                mountain</strong> he uploaded their first song, <em>Slaughter house</em>, to Tumblr in <em>June 2019</em>. This song contains a
                lot of reoccurring themes like ghosts, knives and bang energy. </p>

            <h2>Alt-right fans</h2>
            <p><strong>Sematary</strong> released his first solo album, <em>Rainbow bridge</em>, which was posted to Soundcloud on <em>November 7th, 2019</em>.
            <em>Rainbow bridge 2</em> was later released on <em>March 19th, 2020</em>. During this time <strong>Sematary</strong> gained a lot of alt-right
            fans that he wanted to distance himself from. He defined himself as alt-left which led to backlash from this
            alt-right fanbase, leading to the deletion of his Twitter in <em>April 2020</em>.</p>
            <p>By late <em>2020</em>, following the release of the album <em>Hundred Acre Wrist</em>, <strong>Sematary</strong> reiterated his alt-left stance,
            threatening violence against transphobes and anti-LGBTQ individuals, intensifying the contrast between his
            edgelord aesthetic and alt-left beliefs, making him more of a meme subject.</p>

            <h2>Rise to fame</h2>
            <p>On <em>July 21st, 2020</em>, <Strong>Ghost Mountain</Strong> came back to collaborate with <strong>Sematary</strong> on <em>Hundred Acre Wrist</em> on <em>April
                17th, 2021</em>, <strong>Sematary's</strong> fame rose notably after the positive reception of <em>Rainbow bridge 3</em> in <em>April
                2021,</em>
                especially after a good review from popular music critic <strong>Anthony Fantano</strong>. His endorsement via Twitter
                and a
                subsequent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WC988EhgZM">8/10 mixtape review</a> by <strong>Fantano</strong>
                further boosted <strong>Sematary's</strong> fanbase, increasing Spotify listeners
                to approximately 43,000 within four months.</p>

                <h2>Ghost mountains departure</h2>
            <p>In <em>mid-2021</em>, <strong>Ghost Mountain</strong> left the group, due to having different focuses and a lack of passion for the
                music. For a lot of fans, it was unclear why <strong>Ghost mountain</strong> left <strong>Haunted mound</strong> and speculated that there
                were other reasons behind the departure, like a fight between the two members. To this day we still
                do not know
                know for sure what happened, this resulted in people still trying to find the truth. <strong>Sematary</strong> has since
                then
                also deleted all the music made with <strong>Ghost mountain</strong> from Spotify, making it very hard to listen to these
                songs and fans having to resort using reuploads from other people.</p>
            <h2>Underground Based God</h2>
            <p>Enter <strong>Underground Based God (UBG)</strong>, a significant figure in <strong>Haunted mound</strong> lore. <strong>UBG</strong> escalated the
                curiosity
                surrounding <strong>Ghost Mountain's</strong> departure by doxing both artists and releasing never-before-seen pictures
                on
                TikTok, even uncovering <strong>Sematary's</strong> mom's Facebook page in a quest for information. Currently <strong>UBG</strong> is
                banned
                on TikTok, but the information he released is still available online.</p>
